This module requires a C compiler to build. To install,
execute the sequence

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Win32 users should use the 'make' program on their system.
A ppm package, suitable for Win32 ActivePerl, is available via

 ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/Math-FFT.ppd

for ActivePerl 6xx, or at

 ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/Math-FFT.ppd

for ActivePerl 8xx.

If you do not have permission to install modules in the
Perl site tree on your system, you can install this in
your own library by

   perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/me/perl \
     INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/me/man/man1 \
     INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/me/man/man3
   make
   make test
   make install

To use modules in this location, either set the PERL5LIB
environment variable to include your private module
directory, or else put

   use lib '/home/me/perl/path/to/lib';

at the top of your script.
