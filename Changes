Revision history for Perl extension Math::FFT.

1.28  Sat Sep 03 2005
     - bump version so PAUSE ignores deleted 1.27 package

0.28  Sun Aug 28 2005
     - fix version mistake in META.yml

0.27  Sun Aug 28 2005
     - add method to calculate root mean square of data (suggested
       by Robert Hiller)
     - in calculating the power spectrum, use same logic for
       segments = 1 as is currently done for segments > 1 when
       "number" is specified (suggested by Robert Hiller)
     - in calculating the power spectrum, check if data size
       is an integral power of 2 if segments is not specified
       or if segments = 1 and "number" is not specified
     - in the spectrum method, change the name of the "hamm" window
       function to "hann" (suggested by Robert Hiller). For
       backwards compatibility, "hamm" is still supported.
     - in the pod for the spctrm method, clarify how options
       are to be passed in (suggested by Robert Hiller)

0.26  Sat Dec 04 2004
     - include "arrays.h" in FFT.xs (required for some platforms)
       (thanks to Doug Shubert)

0.25  Thu Dec 28 2000
     - implement the routines of arrays.c of PGPLOT to pass
       arrays to and from C
     - added methods to calculate correlation, convolution
       and deconvolution, and power spectrum
     - added some simple statistical methods

0.15  Tue Dec  5 2000
      - original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
                -n Math::FFT
